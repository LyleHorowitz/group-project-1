// How do I link this to call to CrimeSpot API? What is the CrimeSpot API we decided on?

// How do I add specific attributes to fill out CrimeSpot API results apart from location? (i.e. nature of the crime)

// How do I add time of the incident?

// How do I get the results of all of this to display in a table with rows and columns? (I think I have an idea but, yeah)
